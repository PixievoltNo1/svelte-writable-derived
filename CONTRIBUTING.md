# Before creating an issue or pull request

Review the [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

# Before starting to code

Ensure EditorConfig is set up in your editor. [Some editors support it natively](https://editorconfig.org/#pre-installed), while [others need a plugin](https://editorconfig.org/#download). If EditorConfig is not available for your favorite editor, apply [the configuration](./.editorconfig) manually.

# Before creating a pull request

Run `npm install` and `npm test` using the latest LTS release of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/), and ensure all tests pass.
